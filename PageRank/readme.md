# Pagerank Computation

- Datasets:
  - Dataset 1 is a graph with no more than 10,000 vertices that is obtained from a collection of vectors provided in file: “data.txt”. Each line on the text file consists of a single vector. The vectors are enclosed in square brackets (“ [ ] ”) and the features in the vector are comma separated.
  - Dataser 2 is a prepared subgraph extracted from com-friendster network. This is an undirected graph with 197,091 vertices and 32,971,011 edges. Each line on the csv file consists of three entries: source, target, fixpoint value. We will only use the first two entries. The file is an undirected graph, so each edge {u, v} will show up twice as (u, v) and (v, u)
